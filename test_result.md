# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Implement comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with the following roles:
  - SuperAdmin: Platform-level admin
  - Owner: Company owner with full access
  - Manager: Operations management
  - Accountant: Financial operations
  - Foreman: Production supervisor
  - Driver: Field worker  
  - Guard: Security personnel
  
  Each role should have specific permissions and see only relevant UI modules.

      RBAC Implementation Complete! 
      
      **Implemented Features:**
      1. Backend: 7 roles with granular permissions
      2. Backend: Permission middleware and endpoint protection
      3. Frontend: Dynamic navigation based on permissions
      4. Frontend: Role badges and visual hierarchy
      5. Test Data: 6 test users with different roles
      
      **Visual Verification:**
      - Owner (owner_ali): Full dashboard and all modules visible
      - Guard (guard_omar): Only Attendance module visible
      - Accountant (accountant_fatima): Dashboard, Expenses, Invoices, Attendance visible
      - Driver (driver_khalid): Dashboard, Equipment, Production, Attendance visible
      
      **Ready for Backend Testing:**
      - Test permission checks for all API endpoints
      - Verify 403 errors for unauthorized access
      - Test role-based data access
      
      Test credentials: All users have password "password123"
  - agent: "testing"
    message: |
      **RBAC Backend Testing Complete - 96.7% Success Rate**
      
      **✅ WORKING CORRECTLY:**
      - Authentication: All 6 test users login successfully
      - JWT Context: Proper role and permissions in /api/me endpoint
      - Permission Enforcement: 403 errors correctly returned for unauthorized access
      - Data Scoping: All data properly scoped to company context
      - Most Permissions: 88/91 permission tests passed
      
      **❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND (3 bugs in models.py ROLE_PERMISSIONS):**
      1. **Line 59**: Accountant has equipment read access - should be removed
      2. **Line 70**: Foreman missing equipment create permission - should be added  
      3. **Line 63**: Accountant missing attendance create permission - should be added
      
      **DETAILED TEST RESULTS:**
      - Equipment: Owner✅ Manager✅ Foreman(create❌) Driver✅ Accountant(read❌) Guard✅
      - Production: All permissions working correctly
      - Expenses: All permissions working correctly  
      - Invoices: All permissions working correctly
      - Attendance: All except Accountant create❌ working correctly
      - Dashboard: All permissions working correctly
      
      **NEXT STEPS:** Fix the 3 permission matrix bugs in models.py ROLE_PERMISSIONS mapping.
