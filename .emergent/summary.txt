The trajectory details an iterative development process, transitioning from an initial FastAPI+React MVP to a robust, multi-tenant application. Key phases included the successful implementation of multi-tenancy, followed by a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with 7 distinct roles, complete with backend permissions and frontend UI adaptations. The AI engineer integrated modules from provided PDF documents, such as Project Management, Feasibility Studies, Investments, and Financial Projections. An organizational chart feature was also developed. Significant effort was dedicated to fixing issues, including  references during RBAC implementation, minor permission bugs found by testing agents, and deployment-related fixes (e.g., JWT secret, CORS, missing endpoints). Most recently, the focus shifted to creating role-specific dashboards, starting with a restricted driver view, and is currently extending this to other roles, demonstrating continuous adaptation to evolving user needs.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a Khairat Al Ardh operations management system with core modules like Equipment, Production, Expenses, Invoices, Attendance, and a Dashboard. Early requirements included strong validation, RBAC (Admin/Manager/Accountant/Foreman), PostgreSQL/S3/MinIO support, and Arabic UI. The system was built on FastAPI+React.

Subsequent explicit requests included:
- **Multi-tenancy:** Support for more than one company with data isolation. (Implemented)
- **Role-based user accounts:** Specific roles (Owner, Manager, Accountant, Foreman, Driver, Guard) with differing access and interfaces. (Implemented with extensive RBAC)
- **Website Integration:** Connection with meren.com, meren.net, almagroup.com (Pending clarification/implementation).
- **Oracle-style HR Management System:** Including employee profiles, salary, and vehicle management. (Backend models/APIs implemented)
- **Restricted Driver View:** Showing only personal data (salary, car location). (Driver-specific dashboard implemented)
- **Comprehensive Organizational Chart:** Integration of an 8-department structure. (Implemented)
- **Role-specific restricted dashboards for ALL roles:** Each user to see only relevant data. (Currently being implemented)
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI:** Python web framework for the backend.
- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for data persistence.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
- **Multi-tenancy:** Supporting multiple companies with data isolation.
- **RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control for granular permissions.
- **Pydantic:** Data validation in FastAPI.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework.
- **Supervisor:** Process control for managing services.
- **Arabic RTL:** Right-to-left language support.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, residing in  and  respectively.



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Core FastAPI app. Extensive updates for RBAC, multi-tenancy, and new API endpoints for Project, Feasibility Study, Investment, Financial Projections, Employee, Salary, Vehicle, Department, and Position modules. Fixed  references,  import, and added permission checks.
-   : Defines MongoDB document structures. Modified to include ,  enum, , , , , , , , , , ,  models.  linking added to relevant models. Pydantic annotations and RBAC permissions for new modules were updated.
-   : Main React component. Refactored to integrate , handle routing for all new modules, and implement a  component for dynamic dashboard rendering based on user role.
-   : Manages company context, user authentication, and multi-company switching UI. Modified to integrate user roles and permissions, dynamically filter navigation items, display role badges, and relocate the logout button to the top-right header. A company switcher dropdown was also added.
-   : Newly created file to encapsulate frontend RBAC logic, helping to determine which navigation items a user can see based on their role.
-   : Newly created component to provide a highly restricted view specifically for drivers, displaying only personal salary and vehicle GPS information.
-   : Multiple seed scripts were created (, , , , ) to populate the database with test data for users, companies, projects, employee data, and organizational structure.
-    (e.g., , , , , ): Newly created components to display the UI for the newly integrated modules and their respective data, populated from the PDF analysis.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete creation and integration of role-specific dashboards for all remaining roles (Manager, Accountant, Guard, Foreman).
- Thorough end-to-end testing and validation of all role-specific dashboards to ensure correct data display and isolation.
- Full implementation of file upload/preview (S3/MinIO) and CSV import/export features.
- Website integration with meren.com, meren.net, and almagroup.com.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing role-specific restricted dashboards for all user roles, as explicitly requested by the user (same to all). This effort started with creating a  to provide a highly restricted view for drivers, showing only their personal salary, vehicle GPS location, and a limited navigation menu. This required changes in  to conditionally render dashboards based on the user's role, utilizing a new  component. A seed script () was also created and run to populate relevant driver data. Testing confirmed the Driver Dashboard functions as expected, though a Not Found API error was noted. Following this success, the AI engineer started creating the remaining role-specific dashboards: , , , and , to extend this personalized data view to every user role.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue creating and integrating the remaining role-specific dashboards (Guard, Accountant, Foreman, Manager) and then thoroughly test them.
