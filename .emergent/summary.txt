The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Khairat Al Ardh application into the Khairit Digital Core ecosystem. This involved building out multi-company support with RBAC. The work started by expanding core functionalities, first implementing comprehensive accounting and CRM systems, including backend models, API routes, RBAC permissions, and associated frontend modules. This phase involved debugging  issues and resolving  decorator conflicts. Following this, the engineer developed a full Warehouse Management System backend and initiated frontend components. A significant recent pivot involved integrating MinIO for file upload and implementing CSV import/export. Most recently, the focus has shifted to a complete frontend redesign, guided by user-provided presentation slides, aiming for a modern, production-focused UI with a new  component, revised navigation, and updated pages for Production, Invoices, Expenses, etc.

<product_requirements>
The Khairat Al Ardh application evolved into Khairit Digital Core for multi-company operations (Meren, Madad, Khairat KSA), integrating HR, accounting, procurement, ESG, and AI. Initial RBAC-enabled dashboards for 7 roles and an 8-department org chart were foundational. Key features requested and partially implemented include:
*   **Core Accounting:** Oracle-like features (General Ledger, AP, AR, Fixed Assets, Tax Engine, Multi-currency, Financial Reporting).
*   **Core CRM:** Salesforce-like features (Lead, Accounts/Contacts, Opportunities, Cases, Marketing Campaigns, Sales Analytics).
*   **Infrastructure:** File Upload (MinIO), CSV import/export.
*   **Warehouse Management System:** Products, Inventory, Stock, Transfers, Movements.
*   **Enhanced Accounting:** Payments, Bank Reconciliation, Expense Claims, Budgets.
*   **Enhanced CRM:** Tasks, Activities, Products, Contracts, Forecasting, Email templates.
*   **Frontend Redesign:** A complete UI/UX overhaul to match detailed presentation slides, featuring a new layout (left sidebar, top header), specific typography, color palette, React/Tailwind/shadcn/ui stack, lucide-react icons, i18n, React Query, and new production-focused routes and components.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into a significant frontend redesign. The user provided a detailed guide to transform the frontend UI/UX to match presentation slides, focusing on a production-centric layout, new navigation structure, typography, and color palette. The engineer has started implementing this by:
-   Creating a new  component in .
-   Creating several placeholder page components for the new routing structure in , specifically , , , and .
The work is ongoing, with the next step being to create the remaining new pages and integrate the  and all these new routes into the main  file, replacing or augmenting the existing application structure to achieve the desired visual parity and navigation.
