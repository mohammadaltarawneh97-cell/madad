The previous AI engineer initiated by completing core RBAC-enabled dashboards (Guard, Accountant, Foreman, Manager) for the Khairat Al Ardh app. A user pivot then shifted focus to expanding this foundation into a multi-company Khairit Digital Core ecosystem. This involved setting up a standalone  React/Vite tool on port 3001, although the user opted to bypass its use and directly implement features. The engineer then successfully implemented a comprehensive accounting system (models, APIs, RBAC, 8 frontend modules, navigation) and a CRM system (models, APIs, RBAC, 6 frontend modules, navigation), debugging a  issue during frontend development. Following a deployment readiness check, the user requested further enhancements: expanded accounting and CRM features, alongside a full warehouse management system. The engineer began implementing these, creating backend models, API routes, RBAC, and frontend components for warehouse management. The most recent activity involves adding additional warehouse pages and routes, with more enhanced accounting and CRM components still to be integrated.

The Khairat Al Ardh application began as an operations management system for a single company, focusing on Equipment, Production, Expenses, Invoices, Attendance, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for 7 roles. It expanded to support multi-tenancy and an 8-department Organizational Chart. This application is the foundation for the Khairit Digital Core ecosystem, aiming to unify multiple independent companies (Meren, Madad, Khairat KSA) with shared HR, accounting, procurement, ESG, and AI layers. Key features implemented include all role-specific dashboards. The next phases involved implementing Oracle-like accounting features (General Ledger, AP, AR, Fixed Assets, Tax Engine, Multi-currency, Financial Reporting), Salesforce-like CRM features (Lead, Accounts/Contacts, Opportunities, Cases, Marketing Campaigns, Sales Analytics), and infrastructure like File Upload (MinIO) and CSV import/export. Most recently, further accounting enhancements (Payments, Bank Reconciliation, Expense Claims, Budgets), CRM enhancements (Tasks, Activities, Products, Contracts, Forecasting), and a complete Warehouse Management system (Products, Inventory, Stock) were requested.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing further accounting enhancements, CRM enhancements, and a complete Warehouse Management system, with the user requesting to do all in once. This work is currently in progress, focusing on completing the frontend components.

The backend infrastructure for these new modules has been set up:
-   New model files were created: , , and .
-   API routes for Warehouse Management were created in .
-   RBAC permissions in  were updated to include warehouse access.
-   The new warehouse routes were integrated into the main .

On the frontend, the engineer has initiated the creation of warehouse components:
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
Routes for these new components have been added to  and the frontend server has been restarted. The application currently has partial frontend implementation for Warehouse Management, with full Accounting and CRM systems already in place.
