The trajectory began with the AI engineer continuing development on an existing FastAPI+React Khairat Al Ardh application, focusing on completing role-specific dashboards. All required dashboards (Guard, Accountant, Foreman, Manager) were successfully created, integrated via  routing, and thoroughly tested, resolving minor API errors and database seeding inconsistencies. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested a detailed product specification for a multi-company Khairit Digital Core ecosystem. After initial extensive document generation, the AI self-corrected and clarified with the user that the Khairat Al Ardh application serves as the *foundation* for this broader ecosystem. The most recent task involved deploying a new, standalone React/Vite application named  on port 3001. This tool, provided by the user, is intended to generate IP-safe product requirement documents for Oracle-like Accounting and Salesforce-like CRM features, which represent the next phase of expansion for the Khairit ecosystem. The AI successfully set up this new frontend application, installing dependencies and debugging initial startup issues.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a Khairat Al Ardh operations management system for a single company, featuring Equipment, Production, Expenses, Invoices, Attendance, and a Dashboard, with strong validation and RBAC. This expanded to include multi-tenancy, comprehensive RBAC for 7 roles (Owner, Manager, Accountant, Foreman, Driver, Guard), Oracle-style HR Management (employee, salary, vehicle), and an 8-department Organizational Chart. The application serves as the foundational prototype for a larger Khairit Digital Core ecosystem, which aims to integrate multiple independent companies (Meren, Madad, Khairat KSA) into a unified platform with shared HR, accounting, procurement, ESG, and AI layers. The long-term vision includes advanced features like AI project copilot, computer-vision site sensing, digital twin, carbon MRV, and predictive maintenance. Currently, all role-specific dashboards are implemented and tested, and the next phase involves formalizing requirements for Oracle-like accounting and Salesforce-like CRM features for this integrated ecosystem using a new specification generator tool.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully established and initiated the  frontend application. This new application, running on , is a React/Vite project designed to generate product specifications for Oracle-like Accounting and Salesforce-like CRM features. The process involved creating the  directory, populating it with provided HTML/TypeScript/CSS files for the generator's UI and logic, installing its dependencies via yarn install v1.22.22

success Saved lockfile.
Done in 0.04s., and debugging initial startup issues, including a missing  and ensuring all necessary  plugins were correctly configured and dependencies installed. The  is now confirmed to be running and accessible, ready to be used as a tool to formalize the requirements for the next major feature integrations into the main Khairit application. This marks a transition from building core operational dashboards to planning for advanced enterprise system capabilities within the unified ecosystem.
